# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An interactive desktop application built with C++ and wxWidgets to visualize popular sorting algorithms.  
This tool is designed to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work through real-time graphical representations.

## Features

- **Sorting Algorithms Implemented:**
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort

- **Interactive Controls:**
  - **Add Custom Bar**: Allows users to add a bar of a specific height to the array.
  - **Speed Slider**: Dynamically control the speed of the sorting animation.
  - **Refresh Button**: Resets the array to its initial unsorted state.
  - **Sorting Buttons**: Dedicated buttons to initiate each sorting algorithm.

- **Real-Time Visualization:**
  - Graphical representation of sorting processes.
  - Dynamic updates to the array as sorting progresses.

## üéÆ Usage

- **Add Custom Bar**: Input a height and add a new bar to the array.
- **Adjust Speed**: Use the speed slider to increase or decrease the sorting animation speed.
- **Start Sorting**: Click any sorting algorithm button (Bubble, Merge, Selection, Insertion) to visualize that algorithm.
- **Refresh**: Use the refresh button to clear and regenerate the bar array.
